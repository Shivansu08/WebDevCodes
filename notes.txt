inline elements include a , span, img tags.
we can't change width of inline elements but we can do in block elements.

text alignment: it is used in parent element.
text align: center;
Or use margin i.e,
for horizontal center alignment
margin :0 auto 0 auto; //top left bottom right. 

L-50

font family--> serif and sans serif etc..
* embedded font ---> i.e, to put a familiar font in body or parent element. Also put individual font family in each element.
note: in google font , put link in HTML.

L-53

font-size can be in px,%,em.
100% = 16px = 1em.
note if we put font size 200% or 2em in body and again we put font size in h1(lets say of 300% or 3em) then it will finally increase font size of h1 on top of 2em i.e, firstly it increased 2em then again 3em.
So, to avoid it using em we can put '3rem' (instead of 3em) in h1 font size so it will take 3em in consideration only.

L-54

to change the colour of text use:--
color: #4ab19a;

L-55

font weight--> it adjust weight(or boldness) of text.
eg. font-weight: normal;
font-weight: bold;
font-weight: lighter;
font-weight: bolder;

L-56

line-height
The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text.

L-58

float:-->The float property specifies whether an element should float to the left, right, or not at all.
float: left OR right OR none(default);
NOTE: to remove some text from wrapping around floating image we can use clear
i.e, clear:left //to clear wrapping on left side of text.
and clear:right //to clear wrapping on right side of text.

Note: DON'T use float property for positioning rather use it only for wrapping text around image.

{
    position: absolute---> takes the element out of flow and shifts it according to parent element.
    position: relative---> keeps the element in the flow and shifts in relative to its previous position.
}

* to add dotted line instead of straight line use given code:
hr {
    border: dotted #AEC2B6 5px;
    border-bottom: none;
    width: 5%;
}

### BOOTSTRAP ###
* Use width: ; to reduce size of image or of box.

L-83
Note: z-index only works if we define position of element(except position static);
