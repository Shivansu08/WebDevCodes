text alignment: it is used in parent element.
text align: center;
Or use margin i.e,
for horizontal center alignment
margin :0 auto 0 auto; //top left bottom right. 

L-50

font family--> serif and sans serif etc..
* embedded font ---> i.e, to put a familiar font in body or parent element. Also put individual font family in each element.
note: in google font , put link in HTML.

font-size can be in px,%,em.
100% = 16px = 1em.
note if we put font size 200% or 2em in body and again we put font size in h1(lets say of 300% or 3em) then it will finally increase font size of h1 on top of 2em i.e, firstly it increased 2em then again 3em.
So, to avoid it using em we can put '3rem' (instead of 3em) in h1 font size so it will take 3em in consideration only.
